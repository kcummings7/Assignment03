#Assignment 03
##Katherine Cummings

For this assignment, I produced a 3D printed case and a laser cut case.

Both cases fully enclose the photon and its attachments; each has a pair of holes in the back to allow out the power cord and door switch as well as a pair of holes to mount the back of the box to a wall or standard electrical box.  The lid of each case has a hole that allows both the photon status light and the additional LED to shine through; the former to let the user know it status at a glance, the latter to tell the user whether the door switch is closed or not.  Additionally, both cases have a hole lower on the lid that allows the photon photoresistor to poke through, giving it access to light.  FInally, the laser cut case has a small raster in the lid in the shape of a box to give the lid the appearence of a door and frame.

The 3D case was made with tinkerCAD and Cura and the laser cut case was made with Adobe Illustrator.

Images of both cases can be found under issues.
